		<h2>CSS</h2>
		<p>
			CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is a style sheet language
			used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup
			language such as HTML or XML. In simpler terms, CSS describes how HTML
			elements should be displayed on screen, paper or any other media. By
			separating the presentation of a web page from the content, CSS allows for
			greater flexibility and consistency in the design of a website. It allows
			designers to define the style of an HTML element, such as its font, color,
			size, padding, margin and more, and apply that style to multiple elements
			across a website or multiple pages within a website.
