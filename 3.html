		<h2>JavaScript</h2>
		<p>
			JavaScript is a scripting language that is used primarily for creating
			interactive and dynamic content on web pages. It is a lightweight,
			interpreted or just-in-time compiled, and flexible programming language
			that can be both server-side and client-side. JavaScript allows you to
			manipulate, modify, and add functionality to HTML and CSS in real-time,
			making it the backbone of modern web development. It also allows
			developers to create animations, dynamic user interfaces, forms, and other
			interactive features in web applications. JavaScript is currently the most
			popular programming language in the world, and its versatility and ease of
			use make it a favorite among developers.
